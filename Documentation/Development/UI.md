# UI 

## Store page 

- This needs to be a screen where you can purchase different kind items (categories)
- It would be nice to sort the items per category (so there is an overview where you can select a category and then the items of that category would be shown)
- It needs to show a timer where we can say that the stock will refresh in x amount of time

### Items in category

- Every item has a price and an available quantity, a name and different kind of properties, these can vary in size and need to be shown somehow (maybe limit it to a hard cap) There should be a buy button that can be interacted with to buy an item

## Rig Manager

There is an screen that will activate the moment you click on a rig in the game world. It should also allow you to quickly switch to another tab using a dropdown. The screenshot shows the different content that you can display while using the tabs (shown below)

- Basic Information (Tab) (Left)
	- Displays basic information about the rig (name, age, durability, description)
- Components (Tab) (Middle)
	- Displays information about the current slotted graphicscards and allows you to remove them or show more information
	- There is a manage button that allows you to quickly assign cards to this rig (opens a seperate sub window)
- Performance (Tab) (Right)
	- Displays information about its performance (power usage, heat, future stats)

## Inventory Management

When you click on manage you get prompted with the screen shown below here you can select / filter between the available cards that you have and quickly add it to the selected rig chosen above ^ (Maybe it would be nice to show unavailable cards too in a seperate list?)
