# UI 

## Store page 

- This needs to be a screen where you can purchase different kind items (categories)
- It would be nice to sort the items per category (so there is an overview where you can select a category and then the items of that category would be shown)
- It needs to show a timer where we can say that the stock will refresh in x amount of time

### Items in category

- Every item has a price and an available quantity, a name and different kind of properties, these can vary in size and need to be shown somehow (maybe limit it to a hard cap) There should be a buy button that can be interacted with to buy an item

## Rig Manager

There is an screen that will activate the moment you click on a rig in the game world. It should also allow you to quickly switch to another tab using a dropdown. The screenshot shows the different content that you can display while using the tabs (shown below)

- Basic Information (Tab) (Left)
	- Displays basic information about the rig (name, age, durability, description)
- Components (Tab) (Middle)
	- Displays information about the current slotted graphicscards and allows you to remove them or show more information
	- There is a manage button that allows you to quickly assign cards to this rig (opens a seperate sub window)
- Performance (Tab) (Right)
	- Displays information about its performance (power usage, heat, future stats)

## Inventory Management

When you click on manage you get prompted with the screen shown below here you can select / filter between the available cards that you have and quickly add it to the selected rig chosen above ^ (Maybe it would be nice to show unavailable cards too in a seperate list?)

## HUD
The hud should contain atleast the amount of money and amount of coins someone has and also provide the user with a way to open the Store Page or the build window and see the current time and date

*(example screenshot of the current hud)*

## Build Menu

There should be a way to buy structures that a player can place on the map and can also contain different kind of categories (like the store page) it shouldn't takeover the whole screen since the user needs to place an item after he selected a tile

*(example screenshot of the current build menu)*

## Exchange Menu
There should be a menu that allows a player to exchange its coins for cash and should show crypto value and the current exchange rate, trading fee, a place to fill in how much coins he wants to sell and a purchase
