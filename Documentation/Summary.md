# Crypto Tycoon
### Summary 

A tycoon game where you need to manage your own crypto mining imperium. You start off with a single mining rig and need to work your way up the ladder. This will be a solely single player game.

### Game engine
The game will be made using [Unity](https://unity3d.com). Specifically during development the 2020.3.x LTS version will be used. 

### Planned features
- Purchase and construct items (based on a global stock)
- Mining a virtual coin and trading it for cash
- Generating a virtual coin and make sure value increases/decreases over time
- Randomly introduces timed events that can influence the price of the coin
- Building items on a grid based system
- Heat and heat dissipation based on a grid
- Upgrading based on a success failure system (Black desert online)
- Durability based on product age and upgrade level
- Leaderboards

### Demo version
Currently a demo build will be running using Unity WebGL, performance will suffer and you willl encounter stutters and glitches. The final version will not be released on Web and does not have the same performance issues.
