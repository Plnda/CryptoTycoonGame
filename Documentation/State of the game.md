# Crypto Tycoon

## Main Loop

The player needs to construct mining rigs to gain cryptocurrencies, some can be mined some needs to be earned and staked. We differentiate between mined and staked crypto currencies (More on that later).

To construct mining rigs the player needs a property with space. A property has limited space available so eventually you run out of space and need to buy/rent a new property.

A mining rig has a certain amount of slots available where you can slot in [graphics-cards](#graphic-cards). These cards have certain properties that can give currency every [cycle](#cycles). Based on those properties the rigs will use up [electricity](#electricity) and every property that you own has different base values of electricity that it supports these can be [upgraded](#property-upgrades) with cash.

The more electricity a rig uses the more heat it will output. This needs to be countered by using cooling equipment (airco, fans) or by upgrading your rig. If the temperature of a property rises to high all the items will run less efficient and in turn produce less coins while mining this will also lead to decreased durability of the rig and make it break more easily.

When the durability of a rig reaches zero it will break and needs to be repaired with cash. When repaired the durability will reset back to 100% and starts to mine again.

The player needs to buy these mining rigs and cards off the market, which has its own randomised stock. These will vary per day and most sought after items could be out of stock. As the game progresses more items will unlock that will increase the rate that the player can accumulate coins.

The mined coins can be exchanged for cash that is defined by an exchange-rate this rate will (in the end) always have an uptrend with small events that can make the rate rise or fall (simulating good / bad news).

Another factor on the exchange rate is major news that is pre-programmed. These in-game events can trigger a major rise or fall of the rate and can go on for several (ingame) days. But will mostly communicated to the player beforehand so he can react in time.



### Time
#### Cycles 
The game will run at a faster rate than the real clock. We still need to decide on what the appropriate factor will be. The current (V0.0.24) version has a factor of x4 implemented. For now 4 in-game days will pass every real minute. When we reach the beta stage we can start balancing out the values. 

A cycle will run every second. So all the game mechanics will be based around these cycles.
